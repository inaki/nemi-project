          Our shared vision is to create a modern, collectively built and
          prosperous community called Nemi on the land we have acquired and will
          together own in Ventanilla, Oaxaca. Here we can create our individual
          dream properties, while honoring and nurturing the community pillars
          to respect and protect the land, the community members and our local
          neighbors. Together we will imagine the possibilities of cooperative
          agriculture, sustainable building, renewable energy sources, and
          community spaces to cocreate, heal, teach and learn those from within
          and without. Our community members have been drawn together through
          our wild hearts, each of us unique but with a common curiosity for all
          life offers, youthful spirits, and a deep love for music and human
          connection. We each bring a lifetime of knowledge and experience to
          Nemi, committed to creating an inclusive community building a
          collective dream of healthy slow living.
